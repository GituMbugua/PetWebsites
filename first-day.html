    <h2>Expectations</h2>
      <p>On my first day at Moringa, I was excited but also somewhat curious about how hard it would be.</p>
      <p>Some things I expected were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>start well and get stuck</li>
          <li>start well and do well</li>
          <li>get stuck right at the beginning!</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Reality</h2>
      <p>As the day went along, I realized that all I needed was to focus and understand.</p>
      <p>The technical mentors also helped when i got stuck working with git.</p>
      <p>Basically, what I covered during the day was:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Creating a git repo</li>
          <li>Committing files using git</li>
          <li>Cloning and pushing files to and from github</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
        </ol>
